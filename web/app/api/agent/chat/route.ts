# YOUR ANALYSIS TASK

## 1. PATIENT'S PRIMARY CONCERNS
Identify what the patient is MOST worried about (often different from their stated chief complaint):
- **Stated concern**: What they explicitly said
- **Underlying concern**: What they're actually worried about (fear of cancer, impact on daily life, fear of being dismissed, financial concerns, etc.)
- **Concern severity**: How distressed are they? (Mild/Moderate/Severe)

## 2. EMOTIONAL STATE & MENTAL WELLBEING
Analyze the patient's emotional indicators:
- **Mood indicators**: Anxious, depressed, frustrated, fearful, hopeful, resigned
- **Stress levels**: Signs of acute or chronic stress
- **Coping mechanisms**: How are they handling their condition?
- **Mental health red flags**: Hopelessness, isolation, changes in sleep/appetite, substance use, self-harm ideation (FLAG AS CRITICAL)

## 3. COMMUNICATION PATTERNS
- **Clarity**: Articulate or struggling to express?
- **Minimization**: Downplaying symptoms?
- **Catastrophizing**: Expecting the worst?
- **Hesitations**: Uncomfortable topics?

## 4. HEALTH LITERACY & UNDERSTANDING
- **Understanding level**: Do they understand their condition?
- **Medical terminology use**: Accurate or confused?
- **Misconceptions detected**: Any dangerous misunderstandings?

## 5. SOCIAL & LIFESTYLE CONTEXT
- **Work situation**: Job demands, stress
- **Family dynamics**: Support system, caregiving responsibilities
- **Financial concerns**: Insurance worries, medication costs
- **Daily life impact**: How symptoms affect routine, relationships
- **Support system**: Who helps them?

## 6. BARRIERS TO CARE
- **Practical barriers**: Transportation, time off work, childcare
- **Financial barriers**: Cost concerns, insurance issues
- **Trust issues**: Past negative experiences
- **Cognitive barriers**: Memory issues, complexity of instructions

## 7. PATIENT EXPECTATIONS & GOALS
- **Explicit requests**: Tests, referrals, medications
- **Implicit needs**: Reassurance, validation, being heard
- **Treatment preferences**: What are they hoping for/against?
- **Quality of life priorities**: What matters most to them?

## 8. ADHERENCE INDICATORS
- **Past adherence**: Mentions of not finishing medications
- **Motivation level**: Eager to improve vs. resigned
- **Support for adherence**: Family help, routine

## 9. ACTIONABLE PATIENT INSIGHTS

**CRITICAL PATIENT NEEDS** (Immediate attention required):
- List urgent psychological/social needs

**COMMUNICATION RECOMMENDATIONS**:
- How should the provider adjust their communication?
- What reassurance does this patient need?

**CARE PLAN ADJUSTMENTS**:
- What accommodations would improve adherence?
- What referrals (social work, mental health, financial counseling) might help?

**RED FLAGS FOR ESCALATION** üö®:
- Mental health crisis indicators
- Signs of abuse, neglect, or unsafe home environment
- Non-adherence risks with dangerous consequences

## 10. DIRECT PATIENT QUOTES
Extract revealing statements:
> "Direct quote from patient"
**Significance**: Why this matters

# IMPORTANT GUIDELINES
- Be empathetic and non-judgmental
- Consider health equity and social determinants of health
- Don't make assumptions about demographics unless explicitly stated
- Focus on patient-centered care
- Respect patient autonomy
- Consider trauma-informed care principles

Provide your analysis in clear sections with specific examples. Flag anything CRITICAL in bold with üö® emoji.`,
