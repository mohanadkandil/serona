Treated with medication (NSAIDs, pregabalin), intensive physiotherapy program (18 sessions over 10 weeks), and activity modification. Patient highly compliant with treatment. Follow-up MRI November 2023 shows significant disc regression and improved foraminal stenosis. Clinically near-complete resolution of symptoms. Patient discharged from active care October 2023. This case demonstrates the importance of: 1) Appropriate patient selection for conservative care, 2) Multidisciplinary approach (ortho, PT, neurology), 3) Patient education and engagement, 4) Adequate time for natural healing process. Patient to continue self-management with home exercise program. Annual follow-up recommended. Return PRN if symptoms recur.",
